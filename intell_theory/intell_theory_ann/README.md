# Assignment 2: Neural Networks for Estimation
by YU-Xi-Cheng MC35216  
**All functions are documented**, please check comments in file for details.

# Usage

`fnn.mat` `rbfnet30` `rbfnet60` `rbfnet90` include the trained network, please **LOAD THIS** if u want to run `demo` with this. if not (u wannt to generate a new network), ignore this.

`demo` Demonstrate the whole procedure. **RUN THIS.**

`f` implemented the target function:
$$
z = f(x,y) = (0.3-0.6e^{-x^2})x - (0.8+0.9e^{-x^2})y + 0.3 \sin(\pi x)
$$
`genseries` generates a series by $y(t)=f(y(t-1),y(t-2))$ with initial value $y_0$ and $y_1$, and plot its graph.

`genmesh` generates the meshed surface of $f(x,y)$.

`genffn` generates the feed forward network to fit $f(x,y)$. Need data generated by `genmesh`.

`gennetmesh` generates the meshed surface of network.
